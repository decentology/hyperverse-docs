# Hyperverse Documentation

Welcome to the technical documentation site for the Hyperverse!

## Getting Started

This documentation site is built using [Docusaurus v2](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus).

You can run the site locally by cloning this repository, installing dependencies and starting docusaurus.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/decentology/hyperverse-docs.git
cd docs
yarn
yarn start
```

Edit files in the `/docs` directory to make updates to the documentation pages. Pages will be automatically updated when you are running the development server.

## Files

- `.gitignore` - This specifies which files Git should ignore when committing and pushing to remote repositories.
- `docusaurus.config.js` - This is the configuration file for Docusaurus. You can manage the links in the header and footer, and site metadata here. A more in-depth introduction to this configuration file is available on the [Docusaurus website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration) and full documentation for the API is [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus.config.js).
- `package.json` - This specifies the dependencies for the website and the commands that you can run with yarn.
- `sidebars.js` - This specifies the sidebars for your documentation. The full documentation for this file is available on the [Docusaurus website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar).
- `yarn.lock` - This specifies the full dependencies for the website including the dependencies of the dependencies listed in `package.json`. Do not edit this file directly. Edit `package.json` instead, then run `yarn` as described above.

The .md files in the docs directory are the docs. See the [Docusaurus website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction) for the full documentation on how to create docs and to manage the metadata.
