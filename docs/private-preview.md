# Hyperverse Private Preview

Start building web3 applications in the **Hyperverse Private Preview**.

---

## Getting started

Welcome to the **Hyperverse Private Preview**! This preview gives you the opportunity to build a web3 application using the worldâ€™s first Hyperverse module. During the preview you'll **build a web3 app**, **explore your new app**, **customize your app**, and **share what you built**.

:::info Before getting started

If you're new to web3 you may need to [choose a blockchain](/build/blockchain/overview) and [set up your wallet](/learn/wallet/overview) before getting started.

:::

## Step 1: Build your web3 app

Using the Hyperverse, you'll build a simple web3 application using what is known as the **Tribes Module**. This module allows you to create communities based on your interests that others can join or leave at anytime. To do that, you'll need a basic introduction to the Hyperverse and to run the Hyperverse Tribes module in your local environment.

- [What is the Hyperverse?](/basics/welcome)
- [Environment Setup](/basics/environment)

## Step 2: Explore your new app

After setting up your environment, you'll see an app that allows users to join or leave a set of tribes. At this point, you've completed what we're looking to test in this private preview by establishing your connection to the Hyperverse with a web3 application!

## Step 3: Customize your app

To take things a step further, you can create a custom tribes instance and add your own unique set of tribes. After doing this, you'll have built a completely unique web3 experience using the Hyperverse! Complete the steps here to customize your tribes application.

- [Create an Instance](/learn/hyperverse/create-instance)
- [Add a Tribe](/module/tribes#add-a-tribe)

:::warning Experimental feature

This is an experimental feature meant to give you more flexibility with your application during the private preview. In the future, you will be able to easily build your own custom instance using the Hyperverse.

:::

## Step 4: Share what you built

To share your experience, we'd love if you could update the text **Tribes** on your homepage to your name, alias, or twitter handle and share it with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uqecGxg). If you'd like, you can even share it on Twitter to show the world what you built using the Hyperverse!

Navigate to `src/pages/index.tsx` and replace the **h1** on line 29 with your new text.
