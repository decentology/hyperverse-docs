# Hyperverse Private Preview

Overview of the **Hyperverse Private Preview** and how to get started with your web3 application!

---

## Getting started

Welcome to the Hyperverse â€” the `npm install` for smart contracts! We're so excited you joined us and can't wait for you to get started with our private preview. Our team has been working hard to build an incredible experience for JavaScript developers interested in building web3 applications. Now it's time to let you try it for yourself and improve the Hyperverse before releasing it to the public.

[What is the Hyperverse?](/basics/welcome)

## What to expect

This private preview gives you exclusive access to the Hyperverse features so that you can build web3 applications hyperfast. During the preview you'll **build a web3 app**, **explore your new app**, **share what you built**, and **customize your app**.

:::info Before getting started

If you're new to web3 you may need to [choose a blockchain](/build/blockchain/overview) and [set up your wallet](/learn/wallet/overview) before getting started.

:::

## Step 1: Build your web3 app

Using the Hyperverse, you'll build a simple web3 application using what we call the **Tribes Module**. This module allows you to create communities based on your interests that others can join or leave at anytime. To do that, you'll need to get a basic introduction to the Hyperverse and run the Hyperverse Tribes module in your local environment.

:::info

This video covers getting started with [Flow](/build/blockchain/flow) but you can follow the same steps to build on [Ethereum](build/blockchain/ethereum) or [Algorand](build/blockchain/algorand).

:::

## Step 2: Explore your new app

After setting up your environment, you'll see an app that allows users to join or leave a set of tribes. At this point, you've completed what we're looking to test in this private preview by establishing your connection to the Hyperverse with a web3 application!

## Step 3: Share what you built

To share your experience, we'd love if you could update the text **Tribes** on your homepage to your name, alias, or twitter handle and share it with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uqecGxg). If you'd like, you can even share it on Twitter to show the world what you built using the Hyperverse!

:::info How to add your new text

Navigate to `src/pages/index.tsx` and replace the **h1** on line 29 with your new text.

:::

## Step 4: Customize your app

To take things a step further, you can build a custom tribes instance and add your own unique set of tribes. After doing this, you'll have built a completely unique web3 experience using the Hyperverse! Complete the steps here to customize your tribes application.
