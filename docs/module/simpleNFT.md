An open, decentralized, blockchain-agnostic marketplace for composable smart contracts.

The aim of SimpleNFT module is to give the users the ability to mint, own, and trade SimpleNFTs.

For example, Alice creates a SimpleNFT instance and therefore becomes a tenant of the SimpleNFT module.

Alice can now give other users in the ecosystem minting rights (ability to create an NFT). Once the user has the minting rights, the user can then go ahead and actually mint an NFT.
Now that the NFT has come into existence, it can be transfer the NFT from one user to another.
