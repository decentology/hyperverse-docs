An open, decentralized, blockchain-agnostic marketplace for composable smart contracts.

The purpose of Marketplace module is to give the user the ability to buy, sell, and list their SimpleNFTs using SimpleTokens.

This module is different than the SimpleNFT Marketplace module because in this module the user is using SimpleTokens to make the purchase of SimpleNFTs and not $FLOW tokens.
