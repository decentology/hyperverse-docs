# Compose the Hyperverse

Develop, secure, and monetize composable smart modules on the Hyperverse.

The single most important factor in the success of Web2 has been composability. Developers can easily wire-up different APIs to create a range of applications that would otherwise be time-consuming and cost-prohibitive to create. By composing Smart Modules on the Hyperverse, you're bringing composability to Web3 by developing reusable Smart Contracts for Web2 developers.
