## Blockchain

Blockchains are the underlying technology for the decentralized web.

## Blockchain Wallet

A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. A blockchain wallet allows transfers in cryptocurrencies and the ability to convert them back into a user's local currency. By installing, managing, and funding a blockchain wallet you will be able to deploy and manage transactions on the Hyperverse.

## Block Explorer

A block explorer is a search engine that allows users to easily look up, confirm, and validate transactions that have taken place on a Blockchain.

## DApp

A computer application that runs on a distributed computing system. If you’ve ever developed “serverless” apps on Azure or Amazon this is a similar concept.

## Faucet

A faucet is a tool that allows you to fund your test network account with test network funds. Since wallets often allow you to hold tokens from many different blockchains, this list contains test network faucets you can use to fund your account no matter which wallet you use.

## Smart contract

A smart contract is the code executed on a blockchain.

## Solidity

An object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. It is used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum. Solidity is similar to JavaScript.

## Test Network

Each blockchain has both a main network and a test network. While main networks use tokens that have real world value, each test network (or testnet) operates using tokens with no real world value. These testnet tokens allow users test applications and manage transactions without losing any funds. By funding your test account with testnet tokens, you are free to experiment with transactions for free.
