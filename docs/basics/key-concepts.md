# Key Concepts

Defining the key concepts underlying the Hyperverse.

## Defining the Hyperverse

The Hyperverse is defined as **An open, decentralized, blockchain-agnostic marketplace for composable smart contracts**â€”but what does that mean? This page defines each of these terms in more detail.

## Open

Every aspect of the Hyperverse is built to be completely open. The Hyperverse is open-source, owned by the community and aims to be as diverse and gender balanced as possible.

## Decentralized

The Hyperverse is a decentralized platform run by decentralized governance to help developers build decentralized tools. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in the community has the opportunity to build, discover, learn, compose, and contribute to the Hyperverse.

## Blockchain-agnostic

Each blockchain has its own strengths, weaknesses, goals, and communities. The Hyperverse aims to build blockchain-agnostic tools and resources that support you on whichever blockchain supports your unique needs.

## Marketplace

The Hyperverse takes a unique approach to smart contract development, security, monetization and discoverability that work cross-chain on the Hyperverse resulting in the most comprehensive marketplace for smart contracts ever created.

## Composable

The single most important factor in the success of Web2 has been composability. Developers can easily wire-up different APIs to create a range of applications that would otherwise be time-consuming and cost-prohibitive to create. Web3 brings us the alluring promise of such composability through blockchain smart contracts.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts refer to any code executed on a blockchain. Hyperverse developers have access to a marketplace of smart contracts that include supporting documentation, code samples, UI harnesses, and unit tests. This package of code and supporting resources is referred to as a Smart Module within the Hyperverse.
