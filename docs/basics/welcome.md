## What is the Hyperverse?

The Hyperverse is an open, decentralized, blockchain-agnostic marketplace for composable smart contracts. Our mission is to onboard 10 million Web2 developers to Web3 by making it possible to build decentralized applications without writing a single line of smart contract code. Our cross-chain solutions for smart contract development, security, monetization and discoverability aim to make the Hyperverse the most comprehensive marketplace for smart contracts ever created.
