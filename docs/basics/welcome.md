# Welcome to the Hyperverse

Build web3 applications without writing smart contract code.

---

## What is the Hyperverse?

The Hyperverse makes it simple for JavaScript developers to build web3 apps without writing a single line of smart contract code. It's an open marketplace of community-built, audited, easy to discover **smart modules** that include _smart contracts_, _UI harness_, _documentation_, and _sample apps_. Our goal is to enable millions of web2 developers to build for web3 and unlock its full potential.
