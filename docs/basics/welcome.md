# Welcome to the Hyperverse

Introduction to the Hyperverse and first steps to start your journey into Web3.

## What is the Hyperverse?

The Hyperverse is an open, decentralized, blockchain-agnostic marketplace for composable smart contracts. Our mission is to onboard 10 million Web2 developers to Web3 by making it possible to build decentralized applications without writing a single line of smart contract code. Our cross-chain solutions for smart contract development, security, monetization and discoverability aim to make the Hyperverse the most comprehensive marketplace for smart contracts ever created.

## Hyperverse Overview

The Hyperverse consists of three distinct components:

- Website
- CLI
- Registry

Use the **website** to discover Smart Modules, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your Hyperverse experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages. The **CLI** runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with the Hyperverse. The **registry** is a large database of Smart Modules and the meta-information surrounding it.

## Use the Hyperverse to...

- Adapt Smart Modules for your apps, or incorporate Smart Modules as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away.
- Run packages without downloading using npx.
- Share code with any Hyperverse user, anywhere.
- Restrict code to specific developers.
- Create organizations to coordinate Smart Module maintenance, coding, and developers.
- Form virtual teams by using organizations.
- Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
- Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
- Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

## Getting started

To get started with Hyperverse, you can create an account, which will be available at http://www.hyperverse.dev/~*yourusername*. After you set up a Hyperverse account, the next step is to use the command line interface (CLI) to install the Hyperverse. We look forward to seeing what you create!
