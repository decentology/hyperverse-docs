# Welcome to the Hyperverse

Build decentralized applications without writing smart contract code.

## Introduction to the Hyperverse

The Hyperverse makes it simple for any web developer to build decentralized applications without writing smart contract code. Our goal is to enable millions of Web2 developers to build for Web3 and unlock its full potential.

:::info Quickstart

Start building right away with the [Hyperverse Environment Setup](basics/environment).

## NPM for Smart Contracts

We like to think of the Hyperverse as **npm** for smart contracts. It's a growing collection of community built, reviewed, and audited code that you can easily access to quickly and easily build blockchain applications.

## Why use the Hyperverse?

The Hyperverse is built for Web Developers and makes blockchain development super simple. Here are a few reasons we think you'll love building amazing new blockchain applications on the Hyperverse.

- Build blockchain applications without writing smart contracts
- Access well-written, reviewed, and audited smart contract code
- Get support from a growing community of enthusiastic developers
