# Welcome to the Hyperverse

Build web3 applications without writing smart contract code.

## What is the Hyperverse?

The Hyperverse is an open marketplace of community-built, audited, easy to discover smart modules. Our goal - to make it easy for JavaScript developers to build Web3 apps without writing a single line of smart contract code. Think `npm for smart contracts`.
