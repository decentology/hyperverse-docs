Aaaaaaand we're back! Week 3 is upon us and what an exciting week it will be. Except for the fact that you're stuck with me again. It's Jacob here and this week we'll be starting our journey with something called "composability." What does that even mean? How do we begin to implement it, specifically on Flow? We will begin to answer these questions today.

Please note that this week, I will be cutting back on some videos. Instead, I will walk through the README content (and quest answers) in office hours. This will help prevent you from having to watch too many videos with me in it. Just kidding. But it will help reduce redundancy and contribute to a more interactive learning experience. To clarify, the office hour videos will be updated here after they're over. This also means I will not make a video on the technical implementation of smart contract composability. Instead, I will leave a bunch of notes in this README, and we will walk through it live in office hours. Let's have a blast.

## Smart Contract Composability

We will first start with a video by Nik on an intro to Smart Contract Composability. Afterwards, you can begin to explore how we will implement composability in the rest of this README.

## Day 2 Office Hours

Hi! It's me again, the best developer in the world (Jacob). Today, we will continue our conversation about composability on Flow. Specifically, we will dive into some issues we may encounter using the implementation we learned about yesterday & how to solve them using our lovely friend Access Control.

:::info Thank you!

As a side note, I have greatly appreciated the feedback we have received in the discord. I really enjoy getting to talk to each of you about your initial reactions to Flow, Cadence, Composability, etc. Keep asking questions and having converations, it's great!

## Day 3 Office Hours

Heyoooooooooooo. Jacob reporting in for another super awesome and fun day of Fast Floward content. Today, we will be using what we've learned about Cadence, DappStarter, and Composability to start making our own composability modules. We will have lengthy discussions in the Discord and Office Hours over the next few days to help you in your implementation. Let's have some fun with this and work through this together to make something great.
