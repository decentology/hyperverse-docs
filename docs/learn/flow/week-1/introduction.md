Hello there! My name is Morgan and together with the team at Decentology we'll guide you towards becoming a decentralized application developer during the 3 weeks of FastFloward. When exploring something new, it’s important to limit oneself in terms of scope. There’s only so much time and an infinite amount of material, so we’ll focus on things that lead towards shipping decentralized applications or DApps the fastest.

## Intro to Flow and Cadence

To build any App, one of the first decisions is to choose a platform you'll build on. Same with DApps. We've made this decision for you, and our platform of choice is Flow and Cadence. I'll explain why we think this is a good decision to get started.

## Flow Playground

Welcome back! I hope day 1 was fun and interesting. Today we'll get to learn about another Flow developer tool – **Playground**. Also, we'll write our first _smart contract_ and get to interact with it using _transactions_ and _scripts_. Should be exciting! But first, let's review what we learned during day 1.

## Flow Emulator & Contract Deployment

Welcome to Day 3 of Fast Floward! Today we go back to the always useful `flow-cli` to host the entire Flow environment locally. We'll get to create accounts, sign transactions, and deploy contracts. All of that with the help of the **Flow Emulator**, which is a tiny version of the full Flow blockchain on your computer. Now that's awesome!

## Flow Client Library

Welcome back! It's Day 4 of Fast Floward. Today, we're finally ready to put it all together and ship our first decentralized application – Artist. To do that, we're going to learn about the **Flow Client Library (FCL)**, how to operate on the Flow testnet, and how to integrate Flow with a JavaScript/React client. Don't worry, you won't need to know much about JavaScript or React. All the client-side scaffolding is in place, and you will only have to worry about Cadence, FCL, and the Flow testnet. Day 4 is going to be AWESOME!

## Cadence Interfaces & NFT Trading

Welcome to Day 5, the last day of Fast Floward Week 1! What an incredible spurt we've made over this past week. Starting with simple, interpreted Cadence statements, all the way up to a client implementation of the Artist app that prints actual Non-Fungible Tokens for users. But this is just the start of your journey! Today, we'll add a new feature to the Artist app – trading. In the process, we'll learn how to combine functionality from multiple smart contracts, and a new Cadence concept called `interface`. Let's make Day 5 the best yet!
