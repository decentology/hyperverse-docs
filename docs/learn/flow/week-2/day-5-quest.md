# Quests

I have one quest for you today, `W2Q8`.

- `W2Q8` â€“ Let the Skills Loose!

For this quest, well, I want you to get creative. Now that you have been through all the steps of DappStarter (modifying contracts, transactions, scripts, dapp-lib.js, making action cards, and creating tests) I want you to set out on an adventure and make your OWN changes.

Specifically, I want you to add at least 1 transaction, 1 dapp-lib.js function, 1 action card, and 1 test. I am purposefully being vague here; the goal is to not only test your skills on DappStarter, but also your creativity. It could be literally whatever you want. Your transaction can mint a kitty item and then destroy it, mint 100 kitty items, mint 10000000 kitty items (just kidding, that would take forever). Next week we will begin working on your own projects together, so it is important to practice this creativity step. Also, please feel free to change the contracts if you want to. Spice things up!

Please submit the pieces of code you add.

Good luck on your quests. See you next time DappStarter legends ~
