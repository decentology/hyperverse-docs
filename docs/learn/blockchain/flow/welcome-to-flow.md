# Welcome to Flow

An open, decentralized, blockchain-agnostic marketplace for composable smart contracts

---

Welcome to Fast Floward! We are excited to have you here.

<YouTube videoId="5xqf8ugzsrc"/>

:::info

You may start to [build](../../../build/blockchain/flow), [discover](../../../discover/introduction), or [compose](../../../compose/blockchain/flow) on Flow at any time as you learn.

:::

## Start Learning Flow

<PageRef url="basic/overview" pageName="Flow Basics" />
<PageRef url="intermediate/overview" pageName="Intermediate Flow" />
<PageRef url="advanced/overview" pageName="Advanced Flow" />

## What to Expect

- **Content will be shared every day at 10am Pacific Time.** All content will be shared in this repository. We will send a message in the #⏩-fast-floward Discord channel every day at 10am Pacific Time once content is posted.

- **Content will be paired with Quests to help you put your knowledge to the test.** You can think of these like homework — but way more fun and a lot more creative.

- **We will hold Office Hours** several times throughout the week to help you work through the quests.

- **You can expect about 1.5 to 2 hours worth of videos each week** (note that Week 1 will likely be a bit more) and about 2 to 2.5 hours to spend on the quests throughout the week (this is a minimum, but since they are creative in nature, you can certainly spend more time if you’d like).

- **We highly encourage you to complete all quests.** If you do, we have a special surprise for you at the end of the bootcamp! :wink:

Once you have submitted a Quest, you should see your submission in the #✨-quest-submissions channel in Discord. Feel free to look at other participants' Quest submissions – sharing submissions allows everyone in the Fast Floward program to learn from one another!

If you make an effort to complete all Quests, you will recieve a special surprise at the end of the bootcamp.
