Helloooo! Jacob here. You will be stuck with me for the remaining parts of the bootcamp (Weeks 2 and 3). You have probably seen me in the Discord answering questions, so I hope I'm not a total stranger. Although I am not as awesome as Morgan, I hope we can have some fun and learn so much more about Flow/Cadence together. This week, we will wrap up our introduction to the Cadence programming language and begin to explore DappStarter, a platform created by us at Decentology that allows developers like you to get a full-stack dApp running quickly.

## Wrapping up Cadence Concepts

You should begin by watching the videos below. The first video will wrap up Cadence concepts by going over Access Control. The second will go over Contract Interfaces and Pre/Post-Conditions. The third video will help you download your first Foundation from DappStarter. Lastly, there is a video covering general DappStarter architecture.

## Kitty Items Contract

Review the Kitty Items is a sample project that the Flow team provides to beginners in the Flow universe to learn more about the Cadence language.

## Dapplib, Transactions and Scripts

Hi! It's your favorite person Jacob here to lead you through Week 2 Day 3 content. Yesterday, we went over the 3 contracts in our dApp that we got off of DappStarter. Today, we will be looking at how we can modify our DappLib, transactions, and scripts in order to learn how to interact with our contracts on DappStarter.

## DappStarter Client, UI Harness, and Testing

Heyooo. Jacob here. Previously, we learned how to modify our contracts, transactions, scripts, and dapplib to get our dApp going. Today, we're going to be diving into the UI Harness and Testing on DappStarter, and by the end of it, you'll be conquerors of DappStarter :)

## Final Quest

Wow. You've made it almost an entire week with me. You must be so happy you're almost done with me... psych! We have all of Week 3 together. Anyways, let's conclude Week 2. There is no new content this week. Instead, there is 1 quest to bring together everything you've learned on DappStarter. You've done a great job already, so let's wrap things up and enjoy the weekend.
