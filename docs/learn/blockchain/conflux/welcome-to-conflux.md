## What is Conflux?

Conflux is a new secure and reliable public blockchain with very high performance and scalability. It can achieve the same level of decentralization and security as Bitcoin and Ethereum but provide more than two orders of magnitude improvement on transaction throughput (TPS) and finality latency.
