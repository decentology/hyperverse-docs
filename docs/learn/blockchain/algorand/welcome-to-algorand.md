## What is Teal?

TEAL programming language used in Algorand is a good pick because it is simple for writing and debugging, Turing-incomplete which means it doesnâ€™t support loops and by that, it is more secure than the Turing-complete programming languages such as Solidity. Because of that, it is an ideal programming language for decentralized finances, because, in DeFi, security is the most important as there is handled with huge amounts of finances.
