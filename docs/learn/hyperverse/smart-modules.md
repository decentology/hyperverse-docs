## Smart Modules

Smart Modules are a collection of smart contracts that are designed to cater to one task very well. For the purpose of this hackathon, all smart contracts are written in Cadence programming language since all the modules would be running on a local Flow blockchain emulator.

To begin leveraging the modules, we strongly recommend you to watch the Hyperhack playlist on YouTube. We have created videos for you to understand each smart module in depth.
