# Why Hyperverse

How the Hyperverse plans to onboard the next 10 million Web3 developers.

## Introduction to the Hyperverse

The Hyperverse is an Open, DAO-managed, decentralized marketplace for composable
smart contracts that can support all blockchains. The goal of the Hyperverse is
to onboard the next 10 million Web3 developers by allowing Web2 developers to
quickly and easily build complex blockchain applications.

## Today in Web2

Before getting into what that means, let's take a look at where we are today in
Web2 ( the current version of the internet). In Web2, success has largely been
driven by developers creating APIs. These APIs allow other developers to create
sophisticated applications by using to this growing network of tools and
services. For example, developers can use APIs like Twilio for messaging, AWS
for storage, and Google for location-based services when adding these functions
to their applications.

APIs opened Web2 to millions of developers which resulted in the explosive
growth of Web2 applications. By giving access to simple and secure APIs,
enormous opportunities reached millions of developers around the world who could
access these tools with nothing more than basic computers connected to the
internet. APIs essentially act like developer building blocks that help
accelerate application development. The idea of creating these reusable building
blocks of code is known as composability.

## Currently in Web3

For developers, Web3 presents a ton of friction. Smart contract development
requires advanced skills which are in short supply. The tools Web3 developers
use are rudimentary and the code libraries are often broken. This is partly
related to the fact that things are innovating so fast, making it difficult for
everything to stay in sync. That said, there are a few important things we can
do to help support the Web3 developer ecosystem as they continue building
decentralized applications in this space.

## Bringing Composability to Web3

Similar to Web2, composability can be used to drive opportunity in Web3.

It can allow developers to easily wire-up different APIs to create a range of
applications that would otherwise be time-consuming and cost-prohibitive to
create. Web3 brings us the alluring promise of this type of composability using
smart contracts.

**What’s missing in Web3?**

Web3 is currently missing foundational elements of composability. With a few notable exceptions such as Uniswap, this
promise remains largely unfulfilled. Unlike Web2, there aren’t search engines
for discovering smart contracts based on your app requirements, there’s no way
to tell if a smart contract can be trusted, and there’s certainly no billing
form for pay-as-you-go usage for smart contract developers to monetize their
work.

**No tools and packages**

Since there are no registries or package managers like NPM, Nuget or
RubyGems, developers have no standard way to access metadata, documentation,
unit tests, user interface harnesses and the myriad of other things that are
necessary for smart contract composability at scale. And finally, there isn’t a
standard for smart contract multi-tenant architecture and as a result your
application’s data may be spread across many third-party smart contracts with
all of the associated risks.

**Monolithic smart contracts are risky.**

Due to the shortcomings from lacking foundational elements, developers today
largely build monolithic smart contracts with significant waste of on-chain
storage from code duplication. Longer smart contracts also mean more potential
bugs and vulnerabilities in an environment where code is immutable.

**Achieving smart contract composability at scale isn’t easy.**

In addition to being blockchain-agnostic, a solution for smart contract
composability also has the higher bar of needing to be decentralized both for
infrastructure and governance. At Decentology, we’ve given this problem a lot of
thought. An analysis of thousands of projects created with DappStarter, our
blockchain-agnostic code generation platform, has given us unique insights into
what is required in order to make smart contract composability work at scale.
