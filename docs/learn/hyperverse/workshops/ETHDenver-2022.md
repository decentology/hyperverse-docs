## Introduction to Decentology

_By: Nik Kalyani - Founder/CEO [@techbubble](https://twitter.com/techbubble)_

Decentology is the innovative company behind the Hyperverse, the open, composable smart
contracts marketplace that makes it easy for developers to discover, build, and monetize
Web3 applications. The Hyperverse is the evolution of DappStarter, Decentology's
blockchain-agnostic code generation platform for Web2 developers. Founded in 2019 in
Mountain View, California, the company employs a global team with a mission to onboard the
first 10 million developers to Web3. To deliver on its mission, Decentology partners with some of the leading blockchains in the industry, such as Flow, Algorand, Avalanche, and Conflux.

### What is the Hyperverse?

Our mission is to onboard 10 million driven web developers to Web3, by making it familiar and easy for them to build robust blockchain apps without writing a single line of smart contract code. To bring this innovative vision to life, we are building HyperverseDAO for an open but secure, on-chain code marketplace. And, we're doing this with the power of community and Web3 culture. By making Web3 accessible to millions of existing web developers, the Hyperverse is accelerating the growth and adoption of decentralized technologies at scale.

```

### Demo 3: Tribes Battle with Ethereum & Chainlink

Open the Ethereum Tribes module and select **Battle** to run the Random Pick Demo

_While we wait..._

### What is a Blockchain Oracle?

Blockchain oracles are entities that connect blockchains to external systems, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world.

Essentially an oracle provides a bridge from on chain to off chain data. It enables smart contracts to view data like stock/crypto prices, weather, sporting event scores, and any other real world data. And Chainlink is an oracle that we are using here in this random pick module.
