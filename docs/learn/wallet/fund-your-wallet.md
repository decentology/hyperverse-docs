# Fund your Wallet

Fund your wallet with tokens for your specific blockchain using a faucet.

---

## Getting Started

Once you've installed a [wallet](overview) and created an account you can fund it with tokens. To get started with the Hyperverse, we recommend that you create a [test network](../../basics/glossary#test-network) account and use a [faucet](../../basics/glossary#faucet) to fund it test network tokens. After funding your account, you can view your transactions using a [block explorer](../../basics/glossary#block-explorer). Since wallets often allow you to hold tokens from many different blockchains, the list below contains test network faucets you can use to fund your account no matter which wallet you use.
