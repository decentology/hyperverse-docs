## What is a Blockchain Wallet?

A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. A blockchain wallet allows transfers in cryptocurrencies and the ability to convert them back into a user's local currency. By installing, managing, and funding a blockchain wallet you will be able to deploy and manage transactions on the Hyperverse.
